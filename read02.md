## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
 Important aspects about the unit test
 + The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is gender.py, our test name should be test_gender.py.
 + Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
     + Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
     + Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
     +  Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
+ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
üîµ Refactor the code ‚Äî the first version doesn‚Äôt need to be the beautiful one (don‚Äôt be shy)

## If name equals main
Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value ‚Äú__main__‚Äù. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module‚Äôs name. Module‚Äôs name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 

Advantages : 

+ Every Python module has it‚Äôs __name__ defined and if this is ‚Äò__main__‚Äô, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
+ If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
+ Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
+ if __name__ == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## recursion 
A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.
