##  Linear Regression in Python:

### What Is Regression?

- Regression searches for relationships among variables.

- For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.

- Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

# Linear Regression:

Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It‚Äôs among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.


### Simple Linear Regression

- Simple or single-variate linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression with a single independent variable, ùê± = ùë•.

### Implementing Linear Regression in Python:

- There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model

- we will use scikit learn to perform linear regression.

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains ‚Äúmethods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables.
