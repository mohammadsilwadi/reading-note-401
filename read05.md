## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

+ Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)

  + The amount of time a function needs to complete.

+ Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)

  + The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

## Linked Lists
 In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
